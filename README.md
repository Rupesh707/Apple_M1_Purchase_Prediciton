# Apple_M1_Purchase_Prediciton
**Predict Purchasers of Apple M1 Macbooks using Support vector machine** [Click](https://github.com/Rupesh707/Apple_M1_Purchase_Prediciton/blob/master/Final_Version%203.ipynb)

### 1. PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
The primary objective of the project is to determine the clients that would most likely purchase Apple's newly released M1 Macbook.

### 2. DATA COLLECTION:
The data was collected through a survey sent across different social media channels to a targeted techno savvy groups over 1 week period of time.

### 3. DATA PREPARATION & ANALYSIS :
Collected data is prepared by converting columns with appropriate labels.
Collected data is prepared by encoding Boolean value and converting dtypes.
Datasets are linearly separable using all 22 input features.

### 4. CORRELATION & FEATURE SELECTION :
The dataset consists of multiple suitable features to predit the profile of the clients who would purchase the new Apple's M1 Macbook.

With the help of correlation matrix a strong relationship will be drawn between multiple feature which are then labelled and categorized as independent variable (x) used along with a target variable 'm1_purchase' (y) to fit a model that can predict the profiles of the clients who would likely purchse the new Apple's M1 Macbook.

### 5. MODEL CHOISE:
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) will be used in this notebook as SVM is a very powerful and versatile Machine Learning model, capable of performing linear or nonliner classification, regression, and even outlier detection from the scikit-learn package.
